We selected for each type of administrative area the richest and poorest areas in France (eg: richsest and poorest region, ...). Then we compared the distribution of the nutrition grades of the available products for these two areas.

We see that rich and poor areas can have very different distribution of the healthiness of the available products. However, we cannot infer a correlation from only two areas.

Also, we see that the number of products varies a lot between areas. This was expected, as the products are entered by the users of OpenFoodFacts.
