    alt: Dataset as a graph
    explanations:
        - Our graph is indeed fully connected, but most points are agglomerated into one tight cluster, with a few food items spiking out.

    explanations:
      - This is confirmed by the results of the DBSCAN clustering, which has a maximum Silhouette Coefficient when finding only one cluster.

In order to check if there are existing clusters in our dataset, we visualize our data as a graph. The graphâ€™s nodes are considered to be each food item, and the edges are the nutritional similarity between those nodes (nutritional grade, sugar, fat, protein content and so on). The edge similarity is computed  only with the nutritional features. The economic marker (i.e. the median revenue) is left as a label. The aim of this analysis is to check if products are clustered by their healthiness. If it is the case, are the healthier clusters associated with higher revenues?

This finding shows us that our food products are hence extremely similar amongst them, meaning that they all have similar nutritional features. This finding will contribute to the interpretation of latter results. Indeed, if all of our food products have close nutritional characteristics, there is little chance that we will be able to differentiate them according to economic markers.
