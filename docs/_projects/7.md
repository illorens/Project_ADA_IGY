1. Results + critique
- two significant correlations found: 
    * Arrondissement level: inverse correlation between revenue and energy (kcal per 100g)
    * Region level: inverse correlation between revenue and calorie density (kcal per serving size
- Both support our thesis
    * Poor regions tend to have more caloric food items available than rich regions.
    * Calorie is linked with obesity: we might have found an intermediate link between obesity and poverty
- These correlations do not hold at each geographic level
    * Simpsonâ€™s paradox
    * To be significant, these correlations should hold at ????

2. Dataset criticism
- We do not have information on where most food items are sold
- When the selling location is not null, it does not have a standard format
- Most food items have incomplete information

3. What could we have changed?
