			* Poor regions tend to have more caloric food items available than rich regions.
			* Calorie is linked with obesity: we might have found an intermediate link between obesity and poverty
- These correlations do not hold at each geographic level
			* Simpsonâ€™s paradox
			* To be significant, these correlations should hold at ????
			* These results probably do not indicate an actual link between wealth and healthy food availability

2. Dataset criticism

- We do not have information on where most food items are sold
- When the selling location is not null, it does not have a standard format
- Most of the selling locations are situated in France, which is why we chose to conduct our analysis for this country instead of another one.
- Most food items have incomplete information, which means that some particular features (like fruits and vegetables content, serving size and so on) are rarely filled.

3. What could we have changed?
- Having had a suitable dataset for the task, it would have been worth to conduct our analysis on the US. Indeed, the
