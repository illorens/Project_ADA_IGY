    explanations:
        - The two negative correlations that were found support our thesis. They show that poor regions and arrondissements tend to have more unhealthy available products compared to richer regions. Since in general, the offer follows the demand, these findings could imply that poor areas tend to consume more caloric foods. The consumed calories being linked with body weight, this could indicate an intermediate link between obesity and poverty.

        - However, these correlations do not hold at each geographical level. If it is true that we have a tendency of negative relations between energy and revenue, the exact same metric only occurs once per geographic level. In both cases, we could be dealing with a Simpson's paradox, in which the relations found at a smaller territorial subdivision do not hold or are inverted when analyzing them at a bigger territorial subdivision. We can hence not draw hard conclusions with these findings.

    explanations:
        - Finally, most of the products in our dataset are sold in cities where the median revenue is between 15 000 € and 25 000 €. This corresponds in France to the lower middle class. Having most of our products belonging to a moderate revenue biased our analysis and made us more likely to remove outliers that are in extreme ranges of revenue. Hence, the tendencies evaluated are mostly the ones of the middle class. This could be one reason why the observed results are so limited.

  - A second reason could be the dataset itself, OpenFoodFacts. Indeed, for most food items within the dataset there is no information on where the item is sold. Since we explore the food availability, this feature is essential to us and we need to drop all products that do not indicate their place of selling. Furthermore, when the selling location is not null, it does not have a standard format. Finally, most food items have incomplete nutritional information. The incompletion of the dataset has lead us to dismiss information, and the less information we have, the less robust is our analysis. Our findings are, as a consequence, the findings of an incomplete dataset. 

  - What could we have changed? For starters, choosing a more relevant country to perform our analysis could have yielded better results. The links between poverty and obesity have been well studied and demonstrated in the US, whereas for European countries the link is less obvious. We chose to conduct our study on the French territory because OpenFoodFacts contained much more products sold in France than anywhere else. 

  - Additionally, this research could be augmented with obesity data depicting the percentage of obese and overweight people per territorial subdivision. This way, the obesity data could be linked with the nutritional data and the economic data to provide a more complete analysis. 

  - To sum up, more significant results could have been found with more complete data on food products availability. Most information on our present products was missing, which resulted in an even smaller dataset. Moreover, knowing that our dataset includes predominantly products from low middle class areas, the analysis of the links between wealth and food availability cannot be complete.

The goal of this project was to explore the relation between income and food availability in order to find an intermediate link between obesity and poverty. As we have shown, this problem is not without complexity.

Within the scope of our analysis we have found only two significant ways in which a nutritional feature and a poverty indicator are linked. At the arrondissement level, there is an inverse correlation between the median revenue and the median energy (in kcal per 100g) of the available food items. In addition to that, there is, at the region level, an inverse correlation between the median revenue and the median calorie density (in kcal per serving). We also found a significant positive correlation between the median nutritional grade and the median revenue. However, since all regions but one have the same grade, this relationship is meaningless.
