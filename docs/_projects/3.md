question: What criteria should be used to separate the regions with different socio-economic environments ?

  - By comparing all the above listed economic markers, we observe that there is a high dependency between them all. By retaining only one feature, all the other features can be deducted. The Median Revenue per city was hence retained as our socio-economic marker.
  - Moreover, we need to take into account the territorial level at which our analysis needs to be conducted. Our analysis was focused on Metropolitan France. Indeed, some French regions are located in the Pacific and the Caribbean. Seeing that our analysis examines the eating habits and economical disparities, using a culturally homogeneous territory seems imperative.
  - "There are four types of territorial subdivisions, ranging from largest to smallest: regions, departments, arrondissements and communes. The analysis was conducted at each of the subdivisional levels."

In order to measure poverty, several methods are usually applied. Firstly, comparing the median revenue of different subdivisions of a territory allows the identification of poorer areas. This can be done by using the average revenue as well, although this last indicator is prone to misrepresent the economic level of the area since it can be increased by a few wealthy inhabitants.
Additionally, one can use the poverty rate, which describes the percentage of people whose revenue is below 60% of the median revenue. Finally, a third indicator can be based on the inhabitants' source of income. The sources are namely professional activity, social aid, patrimony and retirement pension.

In order to determine whether these indicators are equivalent, the dependency between the variables is measured using Mutual Information (MI). MI is zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher values mean higher dependency.
