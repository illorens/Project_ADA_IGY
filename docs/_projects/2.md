question: How can we combine nutritional values in order to acquire a metric that indicates the obesogenic level of each food item?
bottom_text:
  - The nutrition grade histogram shows that most of the products are labeled with a 3 or higher, which indicates that healthy products are rare.
  - The nutrition score histogram shows two peaks, one where the products are around 0 (i.e. nutrition grade of 2) and the other one with products around 15 (nutrition grade of 4). Most products are however well above 0 (i.e. nutrition grade of 2 or higher), hence the lack of healthy products is reinforced.
  - The calorie density and deviation histograms follow an inverse power law. Most products have a low calorie density and deviation.

Food grading involves the assessment of various foods regarding quality. Four different nutrition scores for each food item were exploited for our analysis: the nutrition score, the nutrition grade, the calorie density (kcal per serving) and the calorie deviation.

The nutrition score has values between -15 and 40, going from healthy to unhealthy. For each food item, points are added for unhealthy nutritional features such as high energy or high content of fat, sugar and sodium. Points are deducted for healthy nutritional features (high content of fruits, vegetables and nuts, fiber and proteins).


The nutrition grade derives from the nutrition score. It classifies products into five discrete categories, A to E (healthy to unhealthy). For more detailed information about the nutrition scores available on OpenFoodFacts, we encourage visiting their [page on nutrition scores](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore).

Since obesity is often linked with the density in calories of the ingested food items, we decided to introduce two additional nutrition scores: *calorie density* (the calories per serving) and *calorie deviation* (the deviation from the expected nutrients distribution in food items for a healthy diet). The calorie density metric describes how largely a product is packed with calories. The calorie deviation metric describes the deviation from a balanced diet induced by the consumption of a product.


We plotted the distribution of the nutrition grades for all known products in France. The results are striking: available products are in general unhealthy!
