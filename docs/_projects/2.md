question: How can we combine nutritional values such as sugar or fat content, energy and nutrition score in order to acquire a metric that indicates the obesogenic level of each food item ?

Food grading involves the inspection, assessment and sorting of various foods regarding quality, freshness, legal conformity and market value. Two different nutrition scores for each food item were exploited for our analysis, the nutrition score and the nutrition grade.

The nutrition score has values between -15 and 40. -15 indicates a healthy food item, 40 indicates an unhealthy food item. For each food item, points are added for nutritional features considered as unhealthy such as high energy or high content of saturated fat, sugar and sodium. Points are deducted for heathy nutritional features such as a high content of fruits, vegetables and nuts, fiber and protein.

The nutrition grade derives from the nutrition score. It classifies products into five discrete categories, A to E, A describing the healthiest category and E the unhealthiest. Its purpose is to reduce the discrete food categories in order to make the grading system more useful for the consumer.

In addition to these already available food grades, we introduce two more nutrition scores: calory density (the calories per serving) and calory deviation. Obesity is often linked with the density in calories of the ingested food items. The calory density metric describes how largely a product is packed with calories.

Furthermore, nutritional standards state that among the calories that are consumed in a day, 21% should come from proteins, 53% from carbohydrates and 26% from fat. The calory deviation metric is a deviation from this standard for each product. It aims at observing whether the products follow a healthy calory distribution.
