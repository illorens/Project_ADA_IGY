question: How are the wealth and healthy products geographically distributed in France ?
---
Based on our analysis up to now, we have plotted our data on maps. Each French subdivision contains the median value of the evaluated feature. We have plotted every nutritional and economic feature. However, the only pairs for which we found a correlation significant to the 95% level are: 
- Median revenue and calorie density at the region level
- Median revenue and energy at the arrondissement level
