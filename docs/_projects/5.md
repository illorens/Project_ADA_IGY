    alt: Pearson correlation matrix for Arrondissements with significant values in black
    explanations:
        - At the arrondissement level, we can also mostly see the correlations between nutritional features. We can however see that the correlation between nutritional score and median revenue is negative, according to the color bar.

    alt: Pearson correlation matrix for Departments with significant values in black
    explanations:
      - At the Department level (second largest subdivision of the French territory), the correlations between the nutritional features are more accentuated, especially between nutrition score and fat and saturated fat. We can see that the median revenue column (the last column) is positively correlated to the nutrition grade, but negatively to the calorie density.

    alt: Pearson correlation matrix for Regions with significant values in black
    explanations:
        - "Now we can see that the Median revenue column (the last column) has a strong negative correlation with most of the nutritional features: nutrition score, nutrition grade, serving size, energy, fat, saturated fat, sugars, carbohydrates and calorie density. This might indicate that the poorer the region, the worse the quality of the available products. This is reinforced by the fact that the Median revenue is positively correlated with the proteins and fiber (richer regions have more available products that have proteins and fibers)."

question: What are the links between obesity, healthy food availability and socio-economic environment?

The most widespread method of determining the relationship between two variables is the Pearson correlation test. This test was performed at each territorial level between each nutrition feature and the Median Revenue.<br /><br />

We obtained only a few correlations that were significant at the 95% level.
