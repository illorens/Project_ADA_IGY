question: How are the nutrition grade distributed among all the products that we know are available in France ?
excerpt_separator: <!-- more -->
---
We plotted the distribution of the nutrition grades for all known products in France. And the results are striking: available products are in general unhealthy !
<!-- more -->
When we look at the nutrition grade histogram, we see that most of the products are labeled with a `3` or higher, which indicates that healthy products are rare in comparison. 

When looking at the nutrition score histograms, the lack of healthy products is reinforced, however there are also a lot less **very** unhealthy products.

* Nutrition grade has integer values between 1 and 5, 1 indicating healthy food items and 5 describing unhealthy items.

* Nutrition score (UK or Fr.) has values between -15 and 40. -15 indicates a healthy food item, 40 indicates an unhealthy food item. 

The correspondence between the two of them for solid foods is:

* Nutrition grade = 1 : nutrition score $\in [-15, : -1]$
* Nutrition grade = 2 : nutrition score $\in [0, 2]$
* Nutrition grade = 3 : nutrition score $\in [3, 10]$
* Nutrition grade = 4 : nutrition score $\in [11, 18]$
* Nutrition grade = 5 : nutrition score $\in [19, 40]$

The correspondence between the two of them for beverages is:

* Nutrition grade = 1 : Water
* Nutrition grade = 2 : nutrition score $\in [-15, 1]$
* Nutrition grade = 3 : nutrition score $\in [2, 5]$
* Nutrition grade = 4 : nutrition score $\in [6, 9]$
* Nutrition grade = 5 : nutrition score $\in [10, 40]$
