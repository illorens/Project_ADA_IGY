    alt: Pearson correlation for Arrondissements
    explanations:
        - At the arrondissement level, we can see that the only relation that is significant is between energy (in kcal per 100 g) and median revenue (in €). It is a strong negative correlation, which indicates that poorer arrondissements have more unhealthy available food products than their wealthy counterparts.

    alt: Pearson correlation for Departments
    explanations:
      - At the department level (second largest subdivision of the French territory) we find no significant relation between the median revenue and any of the nutritional features.

    alt: Pearson correlation for Regions
    explanations:
        - "At the region level, the median revenue has a strong negative correlation with calorie density and a strong positive correlation with nutrition grade. The first one could indicate that poor regions have more available food products that are densely packed with calories. The second one suggests that poor regions also have products that have a healthier grade. However, for t except for one whose median nutrition grade is 2. Knowing this, we decided that this particular correlation was not informative."

question: What are the links between healthy food availability and socio-economic environment?

The most widespread method of determining the relationship between two variables is the Pearson correlation test. This test was performed at each territorial level between each nutrition feature and the median revenue.<br /><br />

We plotted the correlation tests between the median revenue (€) and each of the nutritional features with their corresponding p-values. We chose the significance level to be at 95%, meaning that a correlation coefficient is only significant if its corresponding p-value is below 0.05. We obtained only a few correlations that were significant at the 95% level.
